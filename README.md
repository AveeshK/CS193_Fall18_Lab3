# CS 193 Lab 3 - Debugging, IntelliJ, & Vim
![](./images/debug_meme.png)

In this lab you will learn some of the fundamentals of debugging your code, as well as some of the tools you have at hand in 2 applications you'll be using a LOT in your CS Career:
- **IntelliJ IDE** (Integrated Development Environment)
- **Vim** (Text Editor)


## Part 1: Setup - "You can't build a great building on a weak foundation"

Debugging is a process that is greatly supplemented by _order_ and _organization_.

One way to ensure this is to configure your tools to the ideal settings, and to
take advantage of *YEARS* of gathered knowledge from the generations of computer 
scientists/developers who preceded you. 

###1.1: Text Editors 

###1.1.1: A solid ~/.vimrc goes a long way

###1.1.2: Know your commands! 

###1.2: 

## Part 2: Debugging Tools - "The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements."


Sometimes, it's as simple as flipping a boolean! (You know what they say about
booleans... even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit ;) )


## Part 3: The Scenario - "One person’s crappy software is another person’s full time job."
Picture this: You land a great internship as a Freshman thanks to all the skills
you learned in CS193, and are put to the task of picking up where last year's 
 IU intern left off. Needless to say, they've left a mess of things, and it's
 up to you to identify what's wrong with their code! 

## Part 4: Sleuthing for Bugs - "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it."

## Part 5: Submit Working Code - "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."

## Optional Extra - Customize your .vimrc to do Syntax Checking
