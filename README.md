![](./images/debug_meme.png)

In this lab you will learn some of the fundamentals of debugging your code, as well as some of the tools you have at hand in 2 applications you'll be using a LOT in your CS Career:
- **IntelliJ IDE** (Integrated Development Environment)
- **Vim** (Text Editor)


### Step 1 - "You can't build a great building on a weak foundation"

### Step 2 - "One person’s crappy software is another person’s full time job."

### Step 3 - 

Sometimes, it's as simple as flipping a boolean! (You know what they say about
booleans... even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit ;) )

### Step 4 - 

### Optional Extra - Customize your .vimrc
